Hi! I’m the CTO and co-founder of [Controla](https://www.controla.ai/), where we’re building an all-in-one cybersecurity platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs face the same digital threats as large corporations but often lack the resources and expertise to manage them effectively. Our mission is to make robust cybersecurity accessible, affordable, and easy to manage, so businesses can focus on growing with confidence.

As a developer, I’m passionate about exploring technology to understand its benefits and drawbacks. I believe in crafting real security solutions that don’t rely on cargo cult practices or security theater but instead provide meaningful protection without getting in the user’s way.

I’m also a strong believer in open source and its community. While I don’t currently develop or maintain open-source projects, I deeply value the open-source mentality that empowers individuals to read, understand, and fix code themselves.

Before founding Controla, I worked as a consultant at [Springflod](https://www.springflod.se/), helping companies in the finance sector enhance their cybersecurity strategies. I’m always excited to use technology to solve real-world problems and empower users to achieve their goals.
